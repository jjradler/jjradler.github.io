  about:
    J. Radler is a freelance software developer, a fledgeling data scientist, and
    an explorer of the vast universe of data and knowledge we are immersed in.
    His professional interests include artificial intelligence, data visualization,
    numerical simulation, mathematical modeling, quantum computation, and both
    technical and scientific communications. What little free time he has is
    devoted to studying geometric algebra, building efficiency and accessibility
    tools for programmers and scientists, and hacking machines of all kinds to do
    his bidding. His less technical recreational pursuits include drawing and
    painting the Seattle urban scenery, playing and listening to music, books of
    all kinds, coffee extraction methods, and spending time with his wife and fuzzball cats.
