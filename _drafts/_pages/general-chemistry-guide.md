## Which Courses Does This Cover?
This guide consists of J's notes and observations from teaching the following
courses at the University of Washington, some of them I have taught several times:
* CHEM 110 --- Introduction to Chemistry course covering everything from
significant digits up through reaction classes and stoichiometry. Some of the
most insightful questions (and the inspiration for this blog post!) came from
the delightful students I had in this course.
* CHEM 142 --- General Chemistry course covering the basics of atomic and
electronic structure, states of matter, stoichiometry, kinetic theory, and
reaction classes.
* CHEM 152 --- General Chemistry course covering introductions to equilibrium,
heat, thermochemistry, and electrochemistry. This is my favorite course to teach.

## The Objectives of This Guide
Peppered throughout this guide are links to handy tools and tips for not only
making it through a General Chemistry course, but **learning something** and
maybe even becoming *inspired* to study more of these subjects on your own.

## The Guide to How To Use The Guide
Some of the things I will say here *may sound like criticism* --- I want you to
keep in mind that I have been there, too. I know what works for me while studying,
and I fully recognize that not everything listed here will work for you. This
page is intended to be an introductory guide for students taking Chemistry at
the UW in Seattle, but also many of the same approaches are generally useful if
you study at any large state university.

Myself, I first encountered this material in classes of 300 students at
Purdue University in Indiana --- another massive state institution that focuses
on STEM subjects --- and it didn't go well until I had learned what worked well
for me when it came to studying.

## Structure and Content
I will not be covering the specifics of the material from these courses on this
page. The emphasis here is on your *methods* for learning and studying the
course contents. The methods you use to tackle your courses at the university
level (and beyond!) make **all the difference** when it comes to your grades.

More importantly, though, *your methods will determine if you actually absorbed
and applied the courses you paid top-dollar for!*
