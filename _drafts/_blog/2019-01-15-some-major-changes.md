I have to be candid here:  

My career, professional life, and goals have undergone a major shake-up since my first post on this site in September of last year. It did not turn out the way I had anticipated, however I think it might be what was best for my mental health and continued career development in the long run. 

To be brief and discreet, I will not mention names or specific times. I also need to be clear that I harbor no ill-will towards any of the characters in this story. My exit from the Halls of Academia (at least for the foreseeable future) was not an acrimonious one. It has been, however, a draining and difficult transition for me. 

Recently I have been largely silent aside from the odd information or link update on this website due to a combination of professional and personal stresses. This stems from my recent struggles with the very nature of academic research. To be a bit clearer — I made the classic mistake of allowing my research successes define who I was and what I was worth. In the end, it caused me to burn myself out. I do not recommend that *anyone* follow my example in that regard. 

I should stop being so cryptic.

In September, I sat down with my previous research advisor (whom I hold in very, very high regard) and we discussed my deteriorating mental health, my lack of substantial support on my ongoing projects, and my future. To paraphrase, he told me that I have many talents, but I was trying to prove myself by overextering myself on all the wrong details. Most importantly, I did not have anything I needed to prove. 

He found it baffling that I was struggling so much when I could clearly do the work. In retrospect, I agree that something more insidious was going in with the way I approached my work. 

I agreed with his assessment wholeheartedly. So we decided to part ways amicably. He had offered his support in continuing my journey, and I imagine he still does. Unfortunately, the outcome of that decision was that I found myself without a research group to work with — essentially a death-sentence for most graduate students in STEM research fields. 

This was a massive, massive shock to my system. 

The shockwaves rippled out through my family. Through my wife, my friends, my colleagues, and everyone who knew me. Some were devastated. Others were angry. Everyone was supportive, however. I am very grateful for that. 

So I began looking for work in the data science and software development fields. In fact, that was one of the motivating factors behind the creation of this very website. 

Soon I found another advisor who seemed willing to work with me, but within a few months it became clear that our working styles did not seem mutually beneficial. Again, I bear no animus towards either of my former advisors. Indeed, I’m grateful they gave me the chances that they did. I’m grateful for the things I had learned, and the friends I had made along the way during my graduate school journey. It seems at this point that the PhD is not in the cards for me barring an appointment to a different department. 

This gets me thinking about what it is I *really* want to do with my talents. Do I want to soldier on and find another science program to hack away at for four more years? Do I forge myself into a software developer here in Seattle and apply my talents towards data science or software engineering? 

These are still somewhat open questions for me. However, it’s a testament to the mentorship of my advisors, especially my first advisor, that I am able to face these decisions at all. Through a dialogue, and his willingness to take me on, I discovered that I have a happy talent for data visualization. I also learned that I was perfectly capable of understanding and applying quantum dynamics and wrapping my brain around the functional aspects of quantum chemistry. I learned that I enjoyed pure mathematics, scripting, and data analysis, too — but more on that in a later post.

I was never a strong student in my undergraduate days. It took me years of struggling to get through my chemistry degree at Purdue. 

It has never been about my capacity to apprehend the knowledge or my skills to complete the work. It has always been about my tools for “getting out of my own way.” I struggled with asking for help, or with admitting when I didn’t understand something. I was afraid to feel stupid. I was even more afraid to be called stupid. I was afraid to put myself out there with imperfect work. 

In short — I was a perfectionist.

Now I am a perfectionist in recovery. A workaholic on the mend. This very post is a testament to that and marks the beginning of my mission to rebuild myself by applying my talents and sharing them with all of you whenever I can. 

I am not afraid anymore. The dream of researching the structure of reality isn’t dead for me, at least. 

So thank you Professors. Thank you University Administrators. Thank you Lecturers and Postcdocs and friends and colleagues. 

So long, and thank you for the Masters Degree. I hope to catch you on the flip-side.
