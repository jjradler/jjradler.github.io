title: A Truth: I Always Struggled with Significant Figures
description: >
  But I did some searching so you don't have to struggle with them like I did!

### Introduction
There is a dirty little secret in physics and chemistry. Anyone who has taught general chemistry — in my experience — also knows what it is.  It's significant figures!

More specificially, it's how we discuss them, how we contextualize them, and how even most graduate students will admit in the strictest confidence that we struggled through learning them in undergrad, promptly forgot about them, and only figured them out by teaching it as Teaching Assistants.

I'll admit it:  _significant figures were the bane of my existence in my undergraduate chemistry courses._

Anyone who knows anything about how my mind works will tell you that I struggle greatly with memorizing seemingly-arbitrary rules that have no real motivation behind their use. I struggled mightily against the subject, finally forgetting I had tried to learn it at all and picking up the rules for the _arithmetic of significant figures_ through scientific practice and observation — indeed giving very little thought to the _why_ and the _how_ of choosing precisions while measuring and recording values in the laboratory.

I find my experience is not an isolated one. Many students in introductory chemistry and physics courses struggle with the _why_ and the _how_ of significant figures.

Unfortunately, by the time we discuss it I find most of my  students already frustrated and confused about _what_ significant figures are, _why_ we care about them, and _how_ to use them.  From a purely mathematical point of view, it makes no sense why we would apply this set of rules to our arithmetic!

However, the proper application of significant figures is _critical_ to science and technology. These are of course realms where numbers are used along with arithmetic and calculus in order to construct or analyze something. In engineering and technology, _significant digits can even make the difference between life and death_!

Another unfortunate thing that I have observed is that many students will have a complete disconnect in their minds between mathematics, science classes, and the actual practice of observation and critical thought. It seems the main approach my students often take to get through high-school chemistry and physics is to memorize formulas and regurgitate them with numbers from question prompts plugged into them. When this approach is used, naturally the connection between the numbers used in the formulas and the numbers that one obtains from observing nature or deriving physical relationships is never solidified.

Of course you’re frustrated! I would be too (and I was)!

So here I will begin by discussing some background on the nature of measurement itself, precision, accuracy, and what we might find ourselves doing with these values we’ve collected from nature.

A student might ask, “_Why don’t you just get on with showing me the arithmetic rules?!?_”

I am explaining it this way because the **rules make no sense out of context**. So first I will provide context and expound a bit on why we need these wonky “sig figs” in the first place.

_Then_ I will tell you how to do the arithmetic.

You are of course free to skip ahead, but I will say that the vast majority of the value in my approach will be lost on you if you just “plug and chug” the formulas and memorize the rules.

So let’s go!

### _What_ are Significant Figures (SigFigs) and _Why_ Should You Care?

Science and technology often involve measurements. In fact, so many things in life involve measurement. An example where my dad and I were tiling a bathroom comes to mind. When tiling a room, you have to measure carefully to account for the area of each tile as well as the gaps between them for grout.

If you don’t measure the tiles correctly, the combination of many small errors while measuring and cutting each tile will add up to form a giant, horrible, awkward mess of tiles that are partially cut at weird angles — as my dad and I found out the hard way!

The point is — your measurements are only as good as the precision of the instrument you’re using to take them.

_What does this have to do with significant figures?_

Significant figures provide a mechanism for minimizing the error in a value derived from multiple measured  values of varying precision.

What do I mean by _precision_?

The number of decimals you measure out to **confidently** is your degree of precision. For example, a balance that is guaranteed to measure out to _five decimal places_, or  $0.00001 = 1\times 10^{-5}$, would give us _confidence to the fifth decimal place_.

In other words — if you have a tape measure and you measure a square tile to have an edge length 0.47” and my dad (I don’t know why he’s here too… just go with it…) measures the square tile to have a length of 0.5” per side, which measurement do you choose? If you have to calculate the amount of tile to cover the space and leave enough room for grout between them, what do you do?

_Your measurement has a greater precision than my dad’s measurement!_

Wait, isn’t that good?

_Not necessarily!_

What would cause probably the least headache in this example might be to err on the side of caution and calculate the number of tiles covering the bathroom using the combination of measurements, but then reduce the precision of the resulting value _to match that of my father’s original measurement._

This would have made that bathroom renovation much easier...

Having said all this, _significant figures allow us to be confident in the accuracy of our calculations within a given degree of precision._ The degree of precision — and thus the number of significant figures —  is set by the degree of precision in the measurements themselves.



### _Why_ Do We Care About Them?

Let’s consider some real-world cases where significant figures during unit conversions caused calamity — believe it or not, there are many!



### _How_ to Apply the Arithmetic of Significant Figures

There is an algorithmic set of rules provided on WikiPedia (among other locations on the Interwebs) that boils down to:

### Some Remarks

Hopefully by now the concept of significant figures seems less frustrating and inconsistent. As I mentioned, I distinctly remember struggling with how to apply them properly up until I began teaching one of  the most  introductory chemistry courses at the University of Washington. My students in that class asked some of the most insightful questions I have ever encountered as an instructor (thanks guys!)

Strangely, in retrospect, as a practicing professional lab technician and later on as a scientist I have definitely been using significant figures more intuitively than algorithmically.

In a sense, if you were to ask a practicing professional chemist or physicist to explain _significant figures_ to you might sound a lot like asking them to explain how they make sure they use the right form of a verb in the English language — they just _do it_.

On the other hand, the explanations I have found online vary between helpful and ludicrous. Most textbooks have very precise definitions, but in the context of the knowledge base already possessed by most students at the introductory level, these definitions are not helpful nor do they provide a motivating context for obtaining mastery of significant figures.

Please feel free to add your own comments to the discussion. If you are an instructor or scientist and have something to add, I could always use more approaches for teaching a seemingly basic and simple but rather confusing topic to my students.  If you are a student, please let me know what you are confused about and I can try to clarify — you may end up helping me understand the topic even better with your question!

Cheers!
