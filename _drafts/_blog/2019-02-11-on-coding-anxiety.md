    A look at how, as a culture, we imprint students and future professionals with
    anxieties and imposter complexes surrounding mathematics, computer
    programming, and science in general through our teaching practices and
    cultural attitudes. This is based purely on my opinions, conversations with
    colleagues, and observations. Accordingly, I claim no expertise outside my
    own experience.

### I struggle with math and coding anxieties. They feed my impostor syndrome.

There, I said it. I have struggled with it despite my choices for courses, graduate school research programs, and personal research interests. I always felt incompetent when it came to mathematics and programming. I have always felt as though logic and linear reasoning eluded me.

This issue is partly due to the fact that I spent my grade school and high school years — as well as my first three years of my Undergraduate career — fighting against an invisible, undiagnosed set of learning "disabilities". I put the word "disabilities" in air-quotes because, while I do struggle sometimes to function and communicate my findings in a way most other people understand, I have no trouble whatsoever actually apprehending the concepts. I have no trouble with reasoning or thinking. 

Indeed, my creativity, verbal skills, and spatial reasoning abilities are likely all consequences of my having to cope with possessing a mind that does not operate in a conventional manner.  

The "disability" is simply the fact that I view these concepts so differently that showing people who view it more conventionally that I actually do know what I'm talking about takes a lot of practice and sometimes patience (on my part and on that of others.)

However, I am beginning to digress, so I will save a more in-depth discussion for a later post.

Sufficed to say that I have struggled with performance anxieties in quantitative subjects for as long time.

And here's the weird part -- _I'm actually pretty damned good at these subjects_.

I'm even good at teaching them to others! (_At least, so I'm told by my students..._)

I have a Masters Degree in Computational and Theoretical Chemistry. I find that I really enjoy writing code and building computing tools. I find proving theorems and performing derivations to be immensely relaxing and rewarding.

I also managed to work around my coding and derivation anxieties in graduate school, eventually becoming a published researcher in the field of quantum computational chemistry. As you read this, keep in mind that I still struggle with feeling like a fraud, with feeling like I don’t know what I’m doing, but I produce work and contribute my skills despite those feelings.

That’s only natural. 

_So why did I struggle so much with these subjects in school?_

My research shows that my experience is not an isolated one, and that I am far from alone [TODO: Link]. Indeed, even so-called _neurotypical_ students struggle mightily with these anxieties. So what's going on here?

### We could first talk about my experiences as...

#### ... A Student

**I was a very, very precocious, curious child.** Curiosity and the need to know _how_ and _why_ are quailties I have retained as an adult. I also loved to build and create, and continue to this day. 

I asked a lot of questions, and fortunately for me my parents had no compunctions with answering them as directly as they could. They treated me and spoke to me like an adult. However, I was always vacillating wildly between two extremes of social behavior — being reserved and shy or extremely talkative to the point where few could get in a word edgewise.  

I loved science and nature. I collected rocks. I studied anatomy and physiology texts. I wanted to go into space and knew way too much about ballistic missiles and rockets. I soaked up minutiae and facts and concepts like a proverbial sponge. 

I also loved computers. 

My dad, uncle, and I used to build one every so often with parts we scavenged from friends’ shops and RadioShack. I didn’t learn to program so much as I learned to hack operating systems and manipulate the command line (i.e., MS-DOS) to get it to do what I wanted. 

I also adored reading and began at a young age. Soon after I was drawing and coloring incessantly to the point where my parents naturally assumed I would be an artist. 

Neither of my parents ever forced me to choose between arts and sciences. In my mind they always were different sides of the same intellectual coin. 

I was quick with both written and mental arithmetic for the most part, but was constantly plagued by inaccuracies despite knowing the solution methods (but more on that in a little while, it will come up again).

**In gradeschool I was bored.  Incredibly bored.**

Rather, I alternated between bored and frustrated.  See, I was struggling with mathematics and science — ironically two subjects I adored before I started studying them in school. When they  became graded and their study became a competition, my inaccuracies were not treated so much as learning experiences as something to be punished. When my teacher could not answer my questions as I had posed them, I was treated like I did not know what I was talking about in general. 

Worse, I frequently failed these regular “timed tests” we had for addition and multiplication tables. Back when I was in gradeschool we were encouraged (read: forced) to learn basic arithmetic by rote-memorization. I can still remember the shame of failing _yet another_ timed test.

Anyone who knows me will tell you that I memorize things very poorly without the provision of some sort of context or underlying mechanism. It’s simply how my mind works. 

No one could explain to me _why_ addition or multiplication worked that way. No one who was teaching me had any better ideas for helping me do better. 

When I got home with yet another failed timed mathematics test, I was scolded at length. 

I wasn’t “applying myself.”

I was “smarter than that.” 

I’ll “end up flipping burgers or going to a junior college if I’m lucky.“

_What IS wrong with me?_ 

Despite my best efforts, I still did poorly in mathematics despite most-of-the-time understanding how it all worked. I would answer questions in class and demonstrate that I knew the concepts, but when it came time for exams I would utterly fail them.

An unstable home life also didn’t help when it came to getting my homework done on time because I didn’t have a quiet place to do it. 

I squeaked by in 8th grade, failing high-school level algebra, and moved on as a thoroughly mediocre student. I was placed in standard courses with content I had covered already when I started 9th grade.

I started to believe that I was bad at mathematics, and no one could help me see otherwise. Nobody could help me find my way. 

So I gave up.

**I spent the first year of high school barely showing up mentally.** It didn’t seem to matter — no matter what I tried or how hard I “applied myself”, it didn’t seem to matter. 

I was frozen. 

Of course at the time I had no idea what was going on. How many 13-year-olds do you know with enough self-awareness to figure out a predicament like this? 

The thing that ended up getting me through high school math was a really, _really_ good geometry teacher who helped me feel empowered (_thank you Mr. Indeck, wherever you are!_). Another _really_ good physics teacher helped me see how beautiful and fascinating science was, as I had apparently lost my passion for it (_another big thank you to Mr. Al Kane, who I hope is still “teaching to the coffeepot” somewhere in the afterlife_.) 

Still, I decided that I was probably going to be an artist or a Navy enlisted man, so I would do my best to get by until graduating and figure it out from there. The NJROTC program at my high school gave me a mentorship network and a stable place to sit and work in the quiet on Wednesday nights. 

I realize looking back that I was highly sensitive to the way the material was presented in a class. If it was via rote-memorization of formulas, I _always_ failed. This was usually because the person teaching me couldn’t answer the questions I asked about _how and why it worked._ It was also because I hadn’t learned enough about myself or accepted that my brain was different. 

Most importantly, I had to _accept and understand that my brain being different was my responsibility to manage_.

Unfortunately, I didn’t do either of those things until much later in my academic career, so my math and science grades continued to be an absolute rollercoaster. 

Indeed, it got much, much worse before it got better.

**Incredibly, despite my fraught relationship with math and science in high school,** an incredibly inspiring AP chemistry teacher (_Mr. Jim Behymer!_) taught me how amazing chemistry was, and that I apparently could do it proficiently. So I applied for chemistry to a number of universities, eventually gaining admission to the Chemistry program Purdue University in Indiana. They even offered me a dual-major track in Materials Science and Engineering. Feeling as though I had something to prove to the world, while also being a ten-foot-tall and bulletproof 18-year-old, I signed up eagerly.  

I was incredibly underprepared for what I was about to go through as an engineering student. 

The program at Purdue is notoriously brutal — especially to its first-year undergraduates. Our first year “Intro to Engineering” seminar course had a speaker effectively say, “Look to your left and look to your right — those two people won’t be here when you finish.”

So begins the competition, I suppose. 

The first-year curriculum is also chock-full of what are colloquially referred to as _weed-out courses_ at Purdue. The 100-level computer science course we had to take? Most people never made it through the first time and often retook it in their Spring Semester, but I’ll discuss the damage this course did to me later. 

How about that 100-level “introduction to engineering problem-solving”?  We needed to memorize formulas out of context and hurl them into MATLAB from overworked, stressed out TAs and deliver relatively complex analyses with minimal guidance, fresh out of high school. 

Needless to say, I washed out of that particular program, opting instead to reenter the university as a chemistry student after completing nine months of penance and reapplication from a community college in Chicago. 

I also found that I wasn’t bad at mathematics as I had previously thought. The realization came from a three-course series in calculus at Harper College in Palatine, IL. My instructors there answered my questions directly. They used a lot of visual techniques and chose textbooks chock-full of figures to illustrate the geometric basis behind calculus. 

It was also around that time that I learned I had a very common learning disability. It made me incredibly creative and able to pursue problems with an almost superhuman focus. However, it caused problems with my linear-reasoning that required many years and a lot of help to overcome. 

I finished my BS at Purdue in five-and-a-half years in 2012, earning a degree in Chemistry. 

The secret for me was to focus on deep-dive classes that taught me as much of the _why_ and _how_ of chemistry as possible. Hey! I passed both terms of Physical Chemistry with a B! I even took computational chemistry and absolutely loved it! 

Successfully implementing these “brain hacks” (as I like to call them) required two things — a compatible approach to learning and a support structure that gave me the space and time necessary to finding that approach. 

Graduate school seemed like something that could really happen. Still, I felt like I really wouldn’t belong there. I felt as though somehow I had tricked and fooled and wheedled my way up to the point where my instructors _thought_ I understood quantum chemistry, linear algebra, or shell scripting.
