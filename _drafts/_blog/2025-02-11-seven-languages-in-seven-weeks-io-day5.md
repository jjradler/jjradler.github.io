**Io Day 2 Self-Study:**

Lots of activities today! Let’s get started! 

**Do:**

*1. A Fibonacci sequence starts with two 1s. Each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers that came before: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,… Write a program to find the nth Fibonacci number. `fib(1) ==> 1`, `fib(4) ==> 3`. As a bonus, solve the problem with both recursion and with loops.*



*2. How would you change `/` to return `0` if the denominator is zero?*



*3. Write a program to add up all of the numbers in a two-dimensional array.*



*4. Add a slot called `myAverage` to a list that computes the average of all the numbers in a list. What happens if there are no numbers in a list? (Bonus: Raise an `Io` exception if any item in the list is not a number.*



*5. Write a prototype for a two-dimensional list. The `dim(x, y)` method should allocate a list of `y` lists that are `x` elements long. `set(x, y, value)` should set a value and `get(x, y)` should return that value.*



*6. Bonus: Write a transpose method so that (`new_matrix get(y, x)) == matrix get(x, y)` on the original list.*



*7. Write the matrix to a file and read the matrix from a file.*



*8. Write a program that gives you ten tries to guess a random number from 1 to 100. If you would like, give a hit of ‘hotter’ or ‘colder’ after the first guess.*
