## A (Very Abbreviated) Biography
J. grew up in various apartments in the North and Northwest suburbs of Chicago, Illinois. Despite being highly mobile, it was a home full of books, music, films, and art supplies. Taking to the arts, literature, and science all at once with gusto at a very young age, he wanted to be everything from a physician to an astronaut; a painter to a professional guitarist; a quiet literary mind and a rockstar.

Strangely enough, after self-studying foreign languages as well as various techniques with many different artistic media in high school, he fell in love with chemistry and physics thanks to an excellent team of teachers at Buffalo Grove High School in Buffalo Grove, Illinois.  Mr. Ken Indeck taught him that he had a knack for geometry and made it enjoyable, priming J.'s mind for later endeavors. Mr. Al Kane taught him that he -- yes, the weird art kid -- could do physics, and that he wasn't just teaching the coffee pot at the back of the room. Then, Mr. Jim Behymer taught him how truly enjoyable mastering matter could be in AP Chemistry. Everyone else thought he was going to go to art school...

J. then applied to a number of universities for chemistry, eventually attending Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana for a dual-major track in Chemistry and Materials Science Engineering.

Things got rough once he got there, however. He was kicked out of Purdue twice for academic deficiency in a three year span, primary due to deficiencies in mathematics and computer programming courses. Eventually, he found a highly visual/spatial learning style and used sketches, colors, and detailed drawings in his studies of multivariable calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and even C programming -- <em>succeeding at these subjects at last</em> while studying during the summer months at Harper College in Palatine, Illinois.

His confidence in mathematics restored, he completed an Associate's Degree of Applied Science in Chemical Technology at Ivy Tech Community College of Lafayette, Indiana. Upon acceptance for reentry to Purdue University, J. spent the next two years studying inorganic, physical, and computational chemistries. He self-studied much of the advanced mathematics required for quantum mechanics and became enamored with quantum computational chemistry.

Upon graduating with his Bachelor's of Science, J. worked as a laboratory technician and manager at the <a href="http://www.physics.purdue.edu/primelab/">Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement Laboratory (PRIME Lab)</a> for three years -- dissolving rocks, testing water, optimizing processing techniques, and fixing laboratory equipment. During this time, he pursued non-degree courses in advanced inorganic chemistry, computational science, and physics, subsequently applying to <em>graduate school after graduate school</em>. Finally, upon striking up a delightful correspondence with Prof. Xiaosong Li at the University of Washington, J. applied and was accepted to pursue a PhD. in Theoretical and Computational Chemistry with <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/ligroup/"> Prof. Li's research group</a> in the Department of Chemistry.

Once there in his role as a Research Assistant, he began sharpening his skills with high-performance computing, scripting, job automation, data parsing, time-frequency analyses, data visualization, scientific visualization, quantum chemistry, and even more applied mathematics.  As a member of Prof. Li's Group he completed his Master's of Science, authored a publication, co-authored another, and presented four original research posters at various conferences and symposia. He also met a number of very good, dear friends along the way.

As a Teaching Assistant at the University of Washington, J. has also had the privilege of teaching and tutoring hundreds of General Chemistry students concepts ranging from quantum mechanics and chemical thermodynamics through various learning and visualization techniques as well as (the ever important) laboratory safety culture.

Stay tuned on the Blog for more adventures in computational and theoretical chemistry!

<h1>Other Scientific Interests</h1>
J. also has a deep interest in making the strange structures of quantum mechanics
more accessible for everyone and devotes a great deal of thought to various representations of quantum phenomena. He also is very curious about everything having to do with quantum mechanics, quantum information theory, mathematics, as well as computer hardware and software. Some of his recent side-projects have explored:
<ul style="list-style-type: disc">
 	<li>Disability resources and tools for dyslexic and dyscalculic people pursuing and working in STEM research roles</li>
 	<li>Fun templates in \LaTeX</li>
 	<li>Mathematical pedagogy</li>
 	<li>Topology</li>
 	<li>Abstract Algebra</li>
 	<li>Geometric Algebra</li>
 	<li>deBroglie-Bohm Theory</li>
 	<li>Braid and Knot Theories</li>
 	<li>Quantum computing</li>
 	<li>Novel visualization techniques for quantum dynamical processes</li>
</ul>

<h1>Other General Interests</h1>
J. has a number of other interests outside of scientific research. He enjoys
acrylic, oil, and watercolor painting, drawing, and various other two-dimensional
forms of visual art. He plays the guitar, the piano, and sings (when no one else
can hear him, though...)

Being a bit of a coffee-snob -- and living in Seattle -- he has been recently
experimenting with various coffee extraction techniques. He also very much enjoys
studying and experiencing the chemistries of various wines, aromatic compounds
in beers, and distillation of liquors. The chemistry of cooking and baking is
another recent interest (are we noticing a theme?)

J. also really enjoys wrenching on machines, and has a passion for German
automobiles. However, having been a graduate student and not being made of
money -- that means Volkswagens! Although he enjoys hacking and modding all
sorts of machines (computers, cars, motorcycles, household appliances...)

Finally, as alluded to previously, J. speaks several languages with varying
degrees of fluency and literacy. He speaks, reads, and writes Japanese
more-or-less fluently, and has had experience teaching complex subjects like
advanced electronic structure theory completely in Japanese.

He also speaks Russian haltingly, and can read Cyrillic just fine, thank you!
Other languages he has been studying recently and with which he has had some
success in conversations include: French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and
Mandarin. He also has a very basic grasp on Korean, Hungarian, Swedish, Welsh,
and Luxembourgish (yes, it's a real language!).

Some would argue (particularly his darling wife) that he has <em>too many</em>
hobbies...

He currently lives in the Eastlake neighborhood of Seattle in a delightful
4-story walkup with his wife and fuzzball cats. He is currently trying to keep
one of the little furry bastards from inputting the self-destruct code on his
MacBook at this very instant...
